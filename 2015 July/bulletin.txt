    NOTICE:  You will Find the Monthly Bulletin on the Web

    Compulife's monthly bulletins will no longer be published with the 
    monthly update.  Instead, monthly bulletins will be published on our 
    website, as they have been since June 2000.  

    To find this month's bulletin, or any of the past monthly bulletins, 
    you can go to the "Help" button on the Red Menu.  When you press the 
    Help Button you will find "Monthly Bulletins" on the list.  When you 
    click on "Monthly Bulletins", Compulife will launch your Internet 
    browser and take you to the Monthly Bulletins web page.

    For those who do not have Internet access, we would like to remind you 
    that Compulife will cease providing disk updates in December 2006.  At 
    that time, all monthly updates will be by Internet.  Later this year, 
    rather than this Notice being automatically displayed, the system will 
    automatically launch the browser and take you to the Monthly bulletins 
    web page.
