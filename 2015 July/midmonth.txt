================================================================

The following changes were made and were included with the

12.  Savings Bank Life Insurance - new rates

June Monthly Update - SBLI Life has introduced 
new rates for its 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 year

This from the company:

Transition Rules

New Rates are available for quoting on June 1, 2015.

New Business Submission and Pending New Business
• Effective June 1, 2015 SBLI will issue pending 
  applications with new rates, if lower than the 
  originally quoted rates.
• Applications submitted to the Home Office between 
  the period of June 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015 should 
  indicate “new rates” on the application if it was 
  sold based on new rates.
• New applications quoted prior to June 1, 2015 and 
  received in the Home Office by June 30, 2015 will 
  be issued with the more favorable rates.

Recently Issued Business
• Policies that have been recently issued and are 
  within 120 days of the exam date may be considered 
  for reissue with the new rates, provided the request

that John Hancock's new Vitality Gold term products
have certain conditions that the insured must meet
in order to preserve the initial level premium.
Failure to meet those conditions can result in

and on, Compulife will reintroduced these 
products back into the "other term" category.

Our thanks and a 10% coupon to the subscriber who 
first alerted us to the issue.
